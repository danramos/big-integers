Big Integers: A facility to allow arithmetic operations on very large integers.
As you know, there is a maximum value for primitive numerical data types, e.g. int, long long, etc.
So.. this..

Goal: Make all the test case pass

Task:
-ONLY Modify implementation of BigInteger class in big-integers.cpp

To build:
1) clone the repo
2) mkdir build
3) cd build
4) cmake ..
5) make [-jN]

To run tests:
6) ./big-integers
